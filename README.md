# Papers We Love - Leuven Chapter

This is the repository for the Leuven chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/leuven/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Welcome

What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Or, just come, listen, and discuss!

We'll be using [papers-we-love's curated repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love). Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.

### Information

Events are posted to the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Leuven/) and will typically be held on Wednesday evenings at the Department of [Computer Science](http://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/) of the [KULeuven](https://www.kuleuven.be).
